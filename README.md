# receipts-react

This web application was ported from a program originally [written in C].

It is a work in progress, but I do use it for my farm receipts.

TODO:

- Redux
- Better form validation for AddReceipt
- Query page

## Start the servers

```
RECEIPTS_DB=/path/to/receipts_db.js ./scripts/start.sh
```

## Screenshots

Check out the pro design.

# receipts-react

This web application was ported from a program originally written in C and can be found [here][1].

It is a work in progress, but I do use it for my farm receipts.

TODO:

- Redux
- Better form validation for AddReceipt
- Query page

## Start the http server

```
RECEIPTS_DB=/path/to/config node ./server/app.js
```

## Screenshots

Check out the pro design.
